# DocWriter - Production Build Guide

## ✅ Production-Ready Features

This application is now **fully production-ready** with:

- ✅ **Built-in Cloud Services** - Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive work out of the box
- ✅ **No Configuration Required** - Users can connect to cloud services immediately
- ✅ **Hardcoded OAuth Credentials** - Embedded directly in the application
- ✅ **Secure User Authentication** - Users log in with their own cloud accounts
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Support** - Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## 🚀 Building for Production

### Windows:
```bash
build-production.bat
```

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x build-production.sh
./build-production.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📦 What Gets Built

The installer includes everything needed:
- OAuth credentials for all cloud services
- Encryption keys for secure storage
- All necessary dependencies
- Auto-update capability

## 🌐 How Cloud Services Work

1. **User clicks "Connect to Google Drive"**
2. **Browser opens** → User logs into their Google account
3. **Google authorizes the app** → Returns to DocWriter
4. **User's files appear** → Can select and use them

The app NEVER sees or stores user passwords. Each user only accesses their own files.

## 📋 OAuth Credentials (Already Embedded)

These are PUBLIC client IDs (safe to share):
- **Google Drive**: `616905817212-03p2kqnjageb1k8tq7p5b1ebr30n866b.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Dropbox**: `o8h7vqoqh8d5yvg`
- **OneDrive**: `f90b1add-e9ec-4ff7-9f9a-6f043c86927d`

## 🔒 Security Notes

- OAuth Client IDs are public (they identify the app)
- User credentials are handled by Google/Dropbox/Microsoft
- Each user authorizes access to their own files only
- No user passwords are ever stored in the app

## 📱 Distribution

After building, distribute the installer found in:
- **Windows**: `dist\DocWriter Setup 1.0.1.exe`
- **Mac**: `dist\DocWriter-1.0.1.dmg`
- **Linux**: `dist\DocWriter-1.0.1.AppImage`

Users can simply:
1. Download the installer
